How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  Using the Junit automation testing program is a great way to do this. It allows you to test the code you are writing as you are writing and will show you how likely your program is to run proficiently. When you write a new function it is a good idea to run the tests so you can see how the new function is affecting the whole program and if that portion is going to work properly. Other than that just proper and consistent syntax is key.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

   Communication is key to this. Having them write clear instructions and details about what they want included is important so you can ensure that they are getting what they want. Keeping an open line of communication is a good idea as well so if you need to ask any questions or they decide to make changes. Look at what they are wanting and plan it all out before you even start writing the code. That way you can come up with a way to make it all work together to make evrything run a lot smoother.

How do I approach designing software?

   Start by planning out everything you want included and what exactly you are wanting it to do. Then figure out how you are going to put it all together in a way that it will work with minimal problems. Decide what language you want to use ahead of time to decide what syntax will work for it. While you are writing the code make sure to leave comments that will help you out later when you are going through it wether to fix or add to the program.
